      Welcome
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm font-semibold tablet:text-xl">
      I’m a mechanical engineer with a knack for software development! I’ll
      graduate from Texas A&M in 2023 with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and
      a minor in Computer Science. Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I really
      hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it. If you have any
      questions or comments, feel free to contact me!

      About Me
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm font-semibold tablet:text-xl">
      I was born in India on April 8, 2001. Little did I know that I wouldn’t
      stay in one place for more than 2 years throughout my life until I turned
      15. I moved from India to Africa to Prague to the United States. When we
      finally touched down in the States we continued moving for my dad’s job
      from Texas to California to Oregon to New Jersey and so on. When I turned
      15, we finally settled down in Frisco, TX. I consider myself lucky to have
      walked through so many different perspectives and I want to continue to
      explore everything this life has to offer! From a young age, I’ve always
      wanted to create and build. Whether it was Legos, or Minecraft, or
      drawing. When I was in middle school, I joined a Lego robotics team which
      sparked my interest in robotics and mechatronics. This is also where I
      threw on my training wheels and started to ride into the programming
      world. In 2019, I got accepted into Texas A&M to study Mechanical
      Engineering and Computer Science. This was where I started to get serious
      about programming since I was required to take classes in it. In the
      middle of my junior year, I got the opportunity to take an 8-month
      internship at Tesla where I met my boss,

        >Don Rudder</a
      >, who forced my eyes open at the true capabilities of software
      development/engineering. I largely consider him my inspiration for truly
      starting to dive into the world of software. Not to mention, he’s an
      absolute legend :). I also love learning about the universe and space
      exploration which is an industry I want to explore at some point in my
      career. My ultimate goal is to find the intersection between creative
      design, artistic expression, mechanical engineering, and software
      development… then I want to live in that world forever.

      My Hobbies
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm font-semibold tablet:text-xl">
      One of the largest parts of my youth was soccer and tennis, but mainly
      tennis. I’ve been competing since I was 8 years old and at my highest, I
      was ranked #10 in Texas for U16s and #42 in the entire nation. When I
      turned 16, I suffered a rotator cuff injury in my shoulder which
      unfortunately derailed my tennis career but allowed me to explore other
      sports such as basketball which I picked up in college. I also enjoy
      drawing and using computer aided design to 3D print anything I can dream
      up. In college, I’m an active member of the Texas A&M Robotics Leadership
      and Experience organization, also known as TURTLE (clever little acronym),
      and an intramural basketball player! I also like to volunteer whenever I
      can. Some other hobbies I enjoy are working out, cooking, and playing
      video games (unsurprisingly).
