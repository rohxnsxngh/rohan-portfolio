    <p class="text-sm font-semibold tablet:font-semibold text-xl">
      I am a driven and ambitious student with a strong background in
      engineering and design. I will graduate from Texas A&M university in fall
      of 2023 with a B.S. in Honors Mechanical Engineering and a minor in
      Computer Science. A few of my favorite aspects of engineering include
      computer-aided design, software development, and engineering
      collaboration. Through my past experience in influential roles, I was able
      to build strong leadership skills and use them to carry out my innovative
      ideas. My diversity in skillsets makes me a very flexible individual who
      can take on different roles and also adapt to new environments. My
      outgoing personality allows me to work well in team environments and my
      independence creates success when completing individual goals or focused
      tasks. I enjoy solving large problems and improving efficiency among
      different items. While I love solving problems, I enjoy my free time by
      playing any sport, reading a book, or drawing.
